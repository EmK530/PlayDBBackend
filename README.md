# PlayDB Backend

This repository contains the PHP scripts from the public branch of the Robot 64 PlayDB backend.

Please do note that these scripts are not identical to the ones used by the main game as these were reprogrammed to be used by others.

## How to use

Either you can follow the guide in Documentation.txt and use the links from the official PlayDB server, or you can host your own server with these scripts.

#### Do note if you choose to use the PlayDB server, this will not gain you access to the main branch but rather a separate version accessible by anyone.

The PlayDB server uses XAMPP to host this, with Apache and MySQL enabled.

If you decide to host your own server, make sure you construct your tables properly.

Below are screenshots from phpMyAdmin showing the structure of all the tables:

#### Levels table:
